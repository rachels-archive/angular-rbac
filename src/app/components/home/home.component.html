<h1>How does Role Based Access System Works?</h1>
<p>
  Angular's AuthGuard works by restricting access to certain routes or
  components based on the roles assigned to the authenticated user.
</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>If user's role is admin, they will be able to view all users.</li>
    <li>If user's role is normal user, they will be denied access.</li>
    <li>If user is not logged in, they will not be granted access either.</li>
  </ul>
  Try it out below!
</div>

<button
  mat-flat-button
  color="primary"
  routerLink="/users"
  routerLinkActive="router-link-active"
>
  View User Dashboard
</button>
